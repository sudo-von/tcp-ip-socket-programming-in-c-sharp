### Host

Host is basically a fancy name for any machine which is connected
to the computer network.
This machine can be a laptop a smartphone, your home router or a server running in the cloud.
It is called a host because it's hosting a software that can communicate over the network.

Every machine is accessible through an IP address wich is unique inside a specific computer network.

In many cases a hostname is used instead of IP address. 

A hostname in turn gets translate to an IP address by a domain name server also known as a DNS.

### IP Address

An IP version 4 address is basically a group of four 8-bit numbers.

I repeat again, an IPV-4 address is a group of four separate 8-bit numbers. The total length of an IP address is 32 bits. Each number in this group can have a value between 0 to 255.

When printing an IP Address, the four numbers are separated by dots to make an IP address easily readable.

This method of printing an IP address is called the dotted decimal notation.
