### Host

Host is basically a fancy name for any machine which is connected
to the computer network.
This machine can be a laptop a smartphone, your home router or a server running in the cloud.
It is called a host because it's hosting a software that can communicate over the network.

Every machine is accessible through an IP address wich is unique inside a specific computer network.

In many cases a hostname is used instead of IP address. 

A hostname in turn gets translate to an IP address by a domain name server also known as a DNS.

### IP Address

An IP version 4 address is basically a group of four 8-bit numbers.

I repeat again, an IPV-4 address is a group of four separate 8-bit numbers. The total length of an IP address is 32 bits. Each number in this group can have a value between 0 to 255.

When printing an IP Address, the four numbers are separated by dots to make an IP address easily readable.

This method of printing an IP address is called the dotted decimal notation.

### Port numbers

In order to understand port numbers, we consider that RPC is an apartment building. This apartment building can be reached using a specific street address. In our computers case,
it will be an IP address.

The building is further divided into apartments and every apartment is identified by a unique apartment number just like apartments.

A computer contains a large but finite number of ports. Each identified by a numeric value. 

A single port can be used to send or receive data by only one process at any given time. When we need to send data to a software process running on another computer.

We need to know the IP address of that remote peer and the port number which is being used by the peer software process. Combination of IP and port is called an endpoint.

A few examples are given on the screen.

There are 65,536 ports on a computer. Port numbers from 0 to 1023

0 - 1023 reserved for operating system usage.

These are called well-known ports or system ports.
